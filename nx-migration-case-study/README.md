# Nx Migration Case Study

A practical case study demonstrating the migration of a real project from a mixed-root structure to a scalable Nx monorepo architecture.

## Overview

This case study documents the complete transformation of a task management application from a traditional React + Express setup into a modern Nx monorepo that supports multi-platform development and future scalability.

## Migration Context

### Starting Point
- **Mixed-root structure**: React app files at repository root level
- **Separate backend**: Express server in `/server` directory
- **Code duplication**: Shared domain logic duplicated across applications
- **Inconsistent tooling**: Different build processes and configurations

### Target Goals
- **Unified workspace**: Single Nx workspace managing all applications
- **Shared libraries**: Extracted common domain logic and utilities
- **Scalable architecture**: Ready for React Native, microservices, and Lambda functions
- **Consistent tooling**: Unified build, test, and deployment processes

### Key Benefits
- **Code reusability**: Eliminate duplication through shared libraries
- **Type safety**: End-to-end TypeScript across all applications
- **Developer experience**: Hot reloading, unified scripts, and better IDE support
- **Future-ready**: Architecture that scales with project growth

## Quick Reference

### Migration Phases

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Core migration | 1-2 weeks | Nx workspace with React + Express apps |
| **Phase 2** | Shared libraries | 1 week | Extracted domain, core, and UI libraries |
| **Phase 3** | Future scalability | Ongoing | React Native app, microservices ready |

### Key Shared Libraries

- **`@task-app/domain`** - Domain entities, value objects, and business rules
- **`@task-app/core`** - Application services, DTOs, and use cases
- **`@task-app/ui`** - Shared React components and design system
- **`@task-app/utils`** - Common utilities and helper functions

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Assessment Phase
- [Current Structure Analysis](./current-structure-analysis.md) - Identify code duplication and architectural issues

### 2. Planning Phase
- [Nx Target Structure](./nx-target-structure.md) - Design optimal monorepo organization

### 3. Execution Phase
- [Nx Migration Steps](./nx-migration-steps.md) - Implement the transformation step-by-step

### 4. Optimization Phase
- [Nx Future Scalability](./nx-future-scalability.md) - Plan for long-term growth and expansion

## Usage Guidelines

### For Similar Projects
1. **Start with assessment** using the current structure analysis as a template
2. **Plan your target structure** based on your specific application needs
3. **Follow the migration steps** adapting them to your codebase
4. **Consider future scalability** early in the planning process

### For Learning Purposes
- **Study the before/after** to understand monorepo transformation benefits
- **Examine shared library extraction** techniques for reducing code duplication
- **Review the scalability planning** for growing personal projects into professional portfolios
