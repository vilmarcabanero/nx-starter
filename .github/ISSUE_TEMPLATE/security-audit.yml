        ## 🚀 Required Setup Steps
        
        **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Using npm or yarn will cause issues!
        
        ### 1. Install pnpm globally (if not already installed)
        ```bash
        npm install -g pnpm
        ```
        
        ### 2. Install project dependencies
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
        
        ### 3. Verify setup by running tests
        ```bash
        # For API components
        pnpm nx test api
        
        # For PWA components  
        pnpm nx test web
        
        # For library components
        pnpm nx test domain
        pnpm nx test application-api
        pnpm nx test application-shared
        pnpm nx test application-web
        pnpm nx test utils-core
        ```
        
        **✅ You're ready to work on this issue once these commands run successfully!**
