        ## 🚀 Required Setup Steps
        
        **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Using npm or yarn will cause issues!
        
        ### 1. Install pnpm globally (if not already installed)
        ```bash
        npm install -g pnpm
        ```
        
        ### 2. Install project dependencies
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
        
        ### 3. Verify setup by running tests
        ```bash
        # For API components
        pnpm nx test api
        
        # For PWA components  
        pnpm nx test web
        
        # For library components
        pnpm nx test domain
        pnpm nx test application-api
        pnpm nx test application-shared
        pnpm nx test application-web
        pnpm nx test utils-core
        ```

        ## Testing Guidelines for Coding Agent
        
        **Required Testing Patterns:**
        - [ ] Follow existing unit test patterns in the codebase
        - [ ] Apply clean architecture testing principles
        - [ ] Focus on SOLID principles compliance in tests
        
        **Recommended Testing Practices:**
        - [ ] Include edge case testing
        - [ ] Add integration test scenarios where appropriate
        - [ ] Mock external dependencies properly
        - [ ] Test error handling and validation paths
        
        **Test Quality Standards:**
        - Write clear, descriptive test names
        - Use proper assertions and error messages
        - Ensure tests are isolated and independent
        - Mock at architectural boundaries
        - Test business logic separate from infrastructure

        ## Clean Architecture Testing Guidelines for Coding Agent
        
        **Architecture Testing Requirements:**
        - [ ] Tests respect dependency inversion (test interfaces, not implementations)
        - [ ] Domain layer tests are independent of infrastructure concerns
        - [ ] Application layer tests properly mock domain and infrastructure dependencies
        - [ ] Tests demonstrate single responsibility principle
        - [ ] Tests follow open/closed principle (extensible without modification)
        
        **Layer-Specific Testing:**
        - **Domain Core**: Pure business logic tests, no external dependencies
        - **Application Core**: Test use cases with mocked domain/infrastructure
        - **Infrastructure**: Test integration points and external service connections
        
        **Dependency Management:**
        - Mock external services at architecture boundaries
        - Use dependency injection in tests
        - Test contracts between layers
        - Validate architectural constraints are maintained
