# Unit Testing Analysis: task-app-gh Test Suite

This documentation provides a comprehensive analysis of the unit testing implementation in the task-app-gh project.

## Overview

The project contains a robust test suite located in the `src/test/` directory, utilizing modern testing technologies and patterns for a React-based todo application with Redux state management.

## Current State

- **Project Directory**: `/Users/vilmar.cabanero/Documents/vilmarcabanero/code/personal/task-app-gh`
- **Test Location**: `src/test/` (23 test files)
- **No Secondary Implementation**: The referenced `task-app-gh-cc` directory does not exist in the current project

## Testing Technology Stack

- **Testing Framework**: Vitest
- **React Testing**: React Testing Library
- **Mocking**: Vitest's built-in mocking capabilities
- **Coverage**: Vitest coverage with v8 provider
- **DOM Environment**: jsdom
