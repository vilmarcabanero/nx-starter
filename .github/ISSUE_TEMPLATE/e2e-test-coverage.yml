        ## 🚀 Required Setup Steps
        
        **⚠️ CRITICAL**: This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Using npm or yarn will cause issues!
        
        ### 1. Install pnpm globally (if not already installed)
        ```bash
        npm install -g pnpm
        ```
        
        ### 2. Install project dependencies
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
        
        ### 3. Verify setup by running tests
        ```bash
        # For API components
        pnpm nx test api
        
        # For PWA components  
        pnpm nx test web
        
        # For library components
        pnpm nx test domain
        pnpm nx test application-api
        pnpm nx test application-shared
        pnpm nx test application-web
        pnpm nx test utils-core
        ```

        ## E2E Testing Guidelines for Coding Agent
        
        **Essential E2E Tests:**
        - [ ] Happy path user flows (main user journeys)
        - [ ] Error handling and edge cases
        
        **Additional E2E Coverage:**
        - [ ] Authentication and authorization flows
        - [ ] Data validation and form submissions
        - [ ] API integration and data persistence
        - [ ] Performance and load testing
        - [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
        - [ ] Mobile and responsive design
        - [ ] Accessibility testing
        - [ ] Security testing (XSS, CSRF, etc.)
        
        **E2E Best Practices:**
        - Use page object models for maintainable UI tests
        - Implement proper test data setup and teardown
        - Use explicit waits instead of implicit delays
        - Create reusable fixtures and utilities
        - Test real user scenarios end-to-end
        - Validate both UI and API integration points

      placeholder: |
        Example:
        - As a user, I want to create a todo item and see it persist after page refresh
        - As an admin, I want to bulk delete todos and receive confirmation
        - As a mobile user, I want to use the app offline and sync when online
        - As an API consumer, I want to handle rate limiting gracefully

        **Run E2E Tests (Short Commands):**
        - `pnpm endapi` - Run API E2E tests (api-e2e)
        - `pnpm endweb` - Run PWA E2E tests (web-e2e)
        
        **Full E2E Commands:**
        - `pnpm e2e` - Run all E2E tests
        - `pnpm e2e:api` - Run API integration tests (api-e2e)
        - `pnpm e2e:web` - Run PWA UI tests (web-e2e)
        - `pnpm e2e:headed` - Run tests with browser UI visible
        
        **Development & Debugging:**
        - API E2E: Uses **Vitest** framework
        - PWA E2E: Uses **Playwright** framework
        - `--headed` - Show browser during Playwright tests
        - `--debug` - Enable debug mode for step-by-step execution
        
        **Test Organization:**
        - **apps/api-e2e/src/api/**: API endpoint tests
        - **apps/web-e2e/src/**: UI interaction tests
        - **fixtures/**: Test data and helpers

      value: |
        ## E2E Testing Standards for Coding Agent
        
        **Required Practices:**
        - [ ] Use page object model for UI tests (Playwright)
        - [ ] Implement proper test data setup and teardown
        - [ ] Use explicit waits instead of implicit delays
        - [ ] Create reusable fixtures and test utilities
        - [ ] Implement proper error handling in tests
        
        **Quality Guidelines:**
        - [ ] Use meaningful test descriptions and assertions
        - [ ] Optimize tests for parallel execution
        - [ ] Implement visual regression testing (if applicable)
        
        **Framework-Specific Guidelines:**
        - **Playwright (PWA)**: Use page objects, proper selectors, and async/await
        - **Vitest (API)**: Use proper mocking, test isolation, and cleanup
        - Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable
        - Use data-testid attributes for stable selectors
        - Implement proper screenshot and trace collection on failure
