# NX Migration Status Summary

## Quick Status Overview

**Current Branch:** `nx-migration`
**Current Phase:** Phase 6 (Frontend Migration) - 85% Complete
**Overall Migration:** 75% Complete

## What's Working ✅

- **✅ All Shared Libraries Built Successfully**
  - `nx build shared-domain` ✅
  - `nx build shared-application` ✅  
  - `nx build shared-utils` ✅

- **✅ Frontend App Builds Successfully**
  - `nx build frontend` ✅ (with warnings about chunk size)
  - All React components migrated and functional
  - MVVM architecture implemented correctly

- **✅ Domain & Application Layers Complete**
  - 241 tests passing in shared-domain
  - All entities, value objects, services migrated
  - All DTOs, use cases, mappers migrated

## What Needs Fixing 🔴

- **🔴 Test Infrastructure Broken**
  - 193 frontend tests failing
  - Missing test helpers (TEST_UUIDS, generateTestUuid)
  - React hook testing issues
  - Invalid Chai properties errors

- **🔴 Missing Dependencies**
  - Several @radix-ui packages needed
  - Testing utilities missing
  - Some import path issues

## Next Actions Required

1. **Create test helpers** (`frontend/src/test/test-helpers.ts`)
2. **Install missing dependencies** (Radix UI components)
3. **Fix test configuration** (vitest.config.ts)
4. **Update failing tests** (fix imports and mocks)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test builds (currently working)
cd nx-starter
nx build frontend
nx build shared-domain
nx build shared-application

# Test functionality (currently failing)
nx test frontend

# Run dev server (currently working)
nx serve frontend
```

## Migration Phases Progress

- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (100%)
- ✅ Phase 2: Shared Libraries Structure (100%)  
- ✅ Phase 3: Domain Migration (100%)
- ✅ Phase 4: Application Layer Migration (100%)
- ✅ Phase 5: App Structure Setup (100%)
- 🔄 Phase 6: Frontend Migration (85% - needs test fixes)
- ⏳ Phase 7: Backend Migration (pending)
- ⏳ Phase 8: Final Configuration (pending)

Once Phase 6 test issues are resolved, the migration will be ready for Phase 7.
