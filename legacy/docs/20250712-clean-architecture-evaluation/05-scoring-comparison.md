  }
}

// Value objects
export class TodoTitle {
  constructor(value: string) {
    if (!value || value.trim().length === 0) {
      throw new InvalidTodoTitleException();
    }
    this._value = value.trim();
  }
}

// ISP: Segregated interfaces
export interface ITodoCommandService { /* Only write operations */ }
export interface ITodoQueryService { /* Only read operations */ }

// DIP: Abstraction dependencies
export class CreateTodoUseCase {
