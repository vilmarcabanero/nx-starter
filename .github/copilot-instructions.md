# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## 0.1 Important!!
1. We have a local copy of the documentations repository at:
~/Documents/vilmarcabanero/code/personal/copilot/docs-context/
Always use this local copy to double check or verify any code, documentation or any output that you generate.
2. There might be symlinks created in the `target` directory:
   - `./target/docs-context`
You can refer to them too for easier access.
3. Always try to look for the documentation in the `./target/docs-context` directory first as there might be separate
documentations for the same tool but with different version.

## 0.2 Important!!
1. If ./target/.research-context directory exists, use them too. They are custom research done that is related to the project.

---

## 0.3 Important!!
1. Always check the existing code patterns and styles in the project.
2. Follow the existing code patterns and styles when writing new code, including the unit tests.
3. Always follow clean architecture and SOLID principles.
