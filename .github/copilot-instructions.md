# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## 0.1 Important!!
1. We have a local copy of the documentations repository at:
~/Documents/vilmarcabanero/code/personal/copilot/docs-context/
Always use this local copy to double check or verify any code, documentation or any output that you generate.
2. There might be symlinks created in the `target` directory:
   - `./target/docs-context`
You can refer to them too for easier access.
3. Always try to look for the documentation in the `./target/docs-context` directory first as there might be separate
documentations for the same tool but with different version.

## 0.2 Important!!
1. If ./target/.research-context directory exists, use them too. They are custom research done that is related to the project.
